The CSS Grid Layout is a 2-D layout system for placement in web pages. Using this we can lay out content out in rows and columns. 
It makes designing complex layouts easy.
Here are the basics

A grid is a collection of columns and rows with gaps between each row and column. The gaps are called gutters.

To define a grid you need to define the following CSS
.container {
    display: grid;
}
we start with a simple page where display grid has not been defined and then to one where templates are defined
