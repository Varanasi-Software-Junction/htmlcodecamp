        "question": "What will the following code output? printf(\"%d %d\", 10, 20);",
        "options": ["10 20", "20 10", "10, 20", "Error"],
        "answer": 0,
        "explanation": "The output will be '10 20' because the first %d is replaced with the first argument (10) and the second %d is replaced with the second argument (20)."
    },
    {
        "question": "What will the following code output? printf(\"%f\", 5);",
        "options": ["5.000000", "5", "5.0", "Error"],
        "answer": 0,
        "explanation": "The output will be '5.000000'. In C, when you use %f with an integer, it is automatically promoted to a float, and printed with six decimal places by default."
    },
    {
        "question": "What is the output of the following code? printf(\"%c %c\", 'A', 65);",
        "options": ["A A", "A 65", "65 A", "Error"],
        "answer": 0,
        "explanation": "The output will be 'A A'. The first %c is replaced by the character 'A'. The second %c is replaced by 65, which is the ASCII value of 'A'."
    },
    {
        "question": "What will be the output of this code? printf(\"%.2f\", 3.14159);",
        "options": ["3.14", "3.14159", "3.1", "3.142"],
        "answer": 0,
        "explanation": "The output will be '3.14'. The %.2f format specifier rounds the float to two decimal places when printed."
    },
    {
        "question": "What does the following code print? printf(\"Hello %s\", \"World\");",
        "options": ["Hello World", "Hello %s", "Hello World!", "Error"],
        "answer": 0,
        "explanation": "The output will be 'Hello World'. The %s format specifier is replaced by the string 'World'."
    },
    {
        "question": "What is the output of this code? printf(\"%d + %d = %d\", 2, 3, 2 + 3);",
        "options": ["2 + 3 = 5", "2 + 3 = 23", "2 + 3 = 2 + 3", "Error"],
        "answer": 0,
        "explanation": "The output will be '2 + 3 = 5'. The printf function evaluates the expression '2 + 3' and replaces the last %d with the result."
    },
    {
        "question": "What does the following print? printf(\"%5d\", 42);",
        "options": ["42", " 42", "   42", "Error"],
        "answer": 2,
        "explanation": "The output will be '   42'. The '5' in %5d specifies a minimum field width of 5 characters. The number is right-aligned by default."
    },
    {
        "question": "What is the output of this code snippet? printf(\"%d %d %d\", 1, 2);",
        "options": ["1 2 0", "1 2", "1 2 1", "Error"],
        "answer": 0,
        "explanation": "The output will be '1 2 0'. The printf function expects three integers, but only two are provided. The third is implicitly assigned the value 0."
    },
    {
        "question": "What will this code print? printf(\"%s %d\", \"Age\", 25);",
        "options": ["Age 25", "25 Age", "Age, 25", "Error"],
        "answer": 0,
        "explanation": "The output will be 'Age 25'. The %s is replaced with 'Age' and %d is replaced with the integer 25."
    },
    {
        "question": "What will the following code output? printf(\"%d%%\", 100);",
        "options": ["100%", "100", "100%%", "Error"],
        "answer": 0,
        "explanation": "The output will be '100%'. The double percentage signs '%%' in printf are used to print a single '%' character."
    },
    {
        "question": "What is the output of printf(\"%.3f\", 3.5);",
        "options": ["3.500", "3.50", "3.5", "Error"],
        "answer": 0,
        "explanation": "The output will be '3.500'. The %.3f format specifier tells printf to display the floating-point number with three decimal places."
