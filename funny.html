      Explanation: .container: This is the main container for the image and the
      overlay. It is set to display: flex to center the child elements
      horizontally and vertically. height: 100vh sets the height of the
      container to be the full height of the viewport. .image-container: This is
      a container for the image. It is set to position: relative so that the
      overlay can be positioned absolutely within it. It has a fixed width and
      height to prevent the image from overflowing. .image: This is the image
      itself. It is set to width: 100% and height: 100% to fill the container.
      object-fit: cover ensures that the entire image is visible and fills the
      container while maintaining its aspect ratio. .overlay: This is the
      overlay that appears when hovering over the image. It is positioned
      absolutely within the .image-container. It has opacity: 0 by default and
      transitions to opacity: 1 on hover. It is set to display: flex to center
      the text vertically and horizontally within it. It has a black background
      color with rgba(0, 0, 0, 0.5) to make it semi-transparent. .text: This is
      the text that appears in the overlay. It is centered horizontally and
      vertically within the overlay and has a white color with a font size of
      24px.
