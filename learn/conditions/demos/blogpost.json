Among these, relational operators and logical operators are fundamental for making decisions and controlling the flow of programs. This post will explore their definitions, uses, and provide examples to solidify your understanding."

Here are the common relational operators:\n\n1. **Equal to (`==`)**: Checks if two values are equal.\n2. **Not equal to (`!=`)**: Checks if two values are not equal.\n3. **Greater than (`>`)**: Checks if the left value is greater than the right value.\n4. **Less than (`<`)**: Checks if the left value is less than the right value.\n5. **Greater than or equal to (`>=`)**: Checks if the left value is greater than or equal to the right value.\n6. **Less than or equal to (`<=`)**: Checks if the left value is less than or equal to the right value.\n\n### Example:\n```javascript\nlet a = 5;\nlet b = 10;\nconsole.log(a < b); // Output: true\nconsole.log(a == b); // Output: false\n```"

The three main logical operators are:\n\n1. **AND (`&&`)**: Returns true if both operands are true.\n2. **OR (`||`)**: Returns true if at least one operand is true.\n3. **NOT (`!`)**: Reverses the boolean value of its operand.\n\n### Example:\n```javascript\nlet isRaining = true;\nlet hasUmbrella = false;\nconsole.log(isRaining && hasUmbrella); // Output: false\nconsole.log(isRaining || hasUmbrella); // Output: true\n```"
