    <h1>QR Codes: An Overview</h1>

    <p>QR codes, short for Quick Response codes, have become an integral part of our digital world. Originally invented in Japan in 1994 by Denso Wave, a subsidiary of Toyota, QR codes were initially designed to track vehicle parts. Over the years, they have evolved beyond their industrial roots and are now used in marketing, payments, product packaging, and much more.</p>

    <h2>What is a QR Code?</h2>
    <p>A QR code is a type of two-dimensional barcode that contains encoded information. Unlike traditional barcodes that can only hold a limited amount of information, QR codes can store much more data—such as URLs, contact information, or even entire paragraphs of text. This is why QR codes are versatile and effective tools for sharing information in a compact form.</p>

    <h2>How Do QR Codes Work?</h2>
    <p>QR codes consist of black squares arranged on a white background in a grid. The code can be scanned by a camera, and specialized software decodes the pattern into readable information. Smartphones, which come with built-in QR scanners, make it easy for anyone to interact with QR codes. The embedded information, like a URL or message, is instantly retrieved and displayed on the user’s screen.</p>

    <h2>Applications of QR Codes</h2>
    <p>QR codes have many real-world applications. Some common uses include:</p>
    <ul>
      <li><strong>Marketing:</strong> Companies use QR codes in advertisements to direct users to websites or promotional pages.</li>
      <li><strong>Payments:</strong> Mobile payment systems like Google Pay and Paytm use QR codes to facilitate cashless transactions.</li>
      <li><strong>Inventory Management:</strong> Similar to traditional barcodes, QR codes help businesses track inventory more efficiently.</li>
      <li><strong>Event Ticketing:</strong> Event tickets with QR codes allow for quick scanning at the entrance.</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>How to Create and Scan QR Codes</h2>
    <p>Creating and reading QR codes is easier than ever with online tools and smartphone apps. You can easily generate a QR code for your website, product, or event, and share it with your audience. Scanning a QR code is as simple as pointing your phone's camera at the code, and the embedded information will be processed in real-time.</p>
